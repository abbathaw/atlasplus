                <strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to any Space and look for the Video Studio button on the sidebar.

            <p>
                <strong>Step 2</strong>: Use the upload form to select a video file (we currently accept mp4 and mov formats).
            </p>
            <img class='atlasplus-screenshot'

            <p>
                <strong>Step 3</strong>: Toggle the DRM protection if you would like your video to have <strong>Digital Rights Management Protection</strong>. Currently we only support DRM protected video playback on Chrome and Firefox browsers. <p>
                Toggle the <strong>Auto Subtitles Generate</strong> if you would like to have our service auto generate the video subtitles. Currently, we only support English language as subtitles.

            <p>
                <strong>Step 4</strong>: After you click upload, the video will be uploaded where it will be also converted to different streaming formats and encrypted. This might take a while depending on the video file size, so please check the status from the video list. Keep in mind that auto-generated subtitles may take longer to show on your video even if the video status is ready.

            <p>
                <strong>Step 7</strong>: After you insert the macro and publish the page, our video player will render on the page. Simply click play. <p><i>Note: DRM protected videos will open in a new tab due to current Confluence iframe restrictions (we hope we get this restriction resolved soon).</i></p>
